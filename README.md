# Custom Cloud Provider Interface

This repository contains a Golang-based implementation of a custom cloud provider interface. It serves as a framework for interacting with a hypothetical cloud platform, abstracting underlying details and offering a consistent resource management interface.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Organized into separate packages for the provider and different resource managers such as instances, storage, and networking, facilitating maintainability and scalability.
- **Interface-Driven:** Utilizes interfaces for resource management, ensuring flexibility and provider-specific adaptability.
- **Extensible:** Designed for easy extension, the project can accommodate additional resource types and management methods as needed.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Golang 1.15 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-cloud-provider.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd custom-cloud-provider
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./custom-cloud-provider
   ```

## Usage

The `main.go` file demonstrates the basic usage of the custom cloud provider interface. Below are some examples on how to use the provider to manage resources:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "custom-cloud-provider/mycloud" // Ensure this import path is correct based on your module setup
)

func main() {
    provider := mycloud.NewCustomProvider()
    ctx := context.Background()

    // Managing instances
    instance, err := provider.Instances().CreateInstance(ctx, "my-instance")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating instance:", err)
    }

    // Managing storage
    bucket, err := provider.Storage().CreateBucket(ctx, "my-bucket")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating bucket:", err)
    }

    // Managing networking
    network, err := provider.Networking().CreateNetwork(ctx, "my-network", "172.16.0.0/16")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error creating network:", err)
    }
}
```

## Extending the Provider

To tailor the provider for your cloud platform, consider the following enhancements:

- **Implement the Resource Manager Interfaces:** Customize `instances.go`, `storage.go`, and `networking.go` to interact with your cloud platform's APIs or SDKs.
- **Expand Resource Types:** Add new manager interfaces and implementations for other resources offered by your platform.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Develop methods for secure authentication and manage access to resources.
- **Configuration Options:** Provide users with the ability to configure the provider using settings like API credentials and region preferences.
